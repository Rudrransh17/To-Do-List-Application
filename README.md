# To Do List

To Do List is a Flutter app designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. With this app, you can easily create, mark as done or undone, and delete tasks. The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface, making it convenient to organize your daily tasks. This README will guide you through the features and functionality of the To Do List app.

## Features

1. **Task Screen:** The app features a task screen where you can view and manage your tasks. Each task is displayed with a checkbox indicating its completion status.

2. **Mark Task as Done or Undone:** You can mark a task as done or undone by simply tapping on the checkbox associated with it. This allows you to track your progress and keep your task list up to date.

3. **Add Task:** To add a new task, tap the floating action button (FAB) located at the bottom right corner of the screen. This action triggers a drawer to slide up from the bottom, where you can enter the name of the task and add it to the task list.

4. **Delete Tasks:** The app provides a delete button within the drawer to completely clear the task list. This feature allows you to remove all tasks at once when needed.

5. **Local Data Storage:** To Do List utilizes the shared preferences package to store task data locally in JSON format. This ensures that your tasks are saved even if you close the app or restart your device.
